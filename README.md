# NEET Simulator (Ludum Dare 37) 

A simple game I made for Ludum Dare 37 using [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.2 in under 48 hours.  
[(Legacy Submission)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=125041)

### About the Game
(very seriosu excerpt from the submission page)
>NEET Simulator! It's a "totally realistic" experience of someone going through the harsh effort of doing mostly nothing every day. In NEET simulator, you can experience some of these things such as:
>1. Playing Video Games
>2. Eating Pizza
>3. Not dying (sometimes)
>
>All at once!



The game is a controlled with the mouse and keyboard, and is focused on **multitasking**.
There is a retro LCD racing inspired game on the righthand side controlled by the keyboard.
To the lefthand side, you have to occasionally "feed" the character "pizzas" that are being delivered,
and then stack the empty boxes to the side.  
Failing either game results in a **game over**.
